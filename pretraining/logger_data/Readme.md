In this folder are the raw data that have been used to generate the different figures.

- `logger_data_pretraining_su4`: contains the data associated with the comparisons between quantum hybrid protocols.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_borders_hadamard_state`: contains the data of the performance comparison between the Gibbs states and the Hadamard states $\ket{+}^{\otimes n}$.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_borders_one_state`: contains the data of the performance comparison between the Gibbs states and the product states.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_heat_map`: contains the data that allows generating the state heat map.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_heat_map`: contains the data that allows generating the state heat map.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_temperature`: Contains performance comparison data between Gibbs states of different temperatures.

- `logger_data_qaoa_performance_gibbs_states_expressivity_random_energy_n_10`: file that contains the data of the area associated with the manifold generated by the QAOA circuit for different initialization states.
