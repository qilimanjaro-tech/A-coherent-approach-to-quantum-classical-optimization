In this folder you will find the files necessary to carry out the performance study of the pure Gibbs states. Each of the `.py` files is intended to perform a performance test, here is the purpose of each one:

- `qaoa_max_cut_border_hadamard_state.py` : implements a performance comparison between Gibbs states and the Hadamard state $\ket{+}^{\otimes n}$.

- `qaoa_max_cut_border_one_state.py` : implements a performance comparison between Gibbs states and products states.

- `qaoa_max_cut_expressivity_analysis_random_energy.py` : implements an analysis of the area owned by the manifold generated by the QAOA circuit for different initialization states. 

- `qaoa_max_cut_heat_map.py` : implements a performance analysis for different initialization states to build the heat map plot. 

- `qaoa_max_cut_temperature.py` : implements an analysis of performance between different temperatures.


Each of these files makes use of auxiliary functions that are contained in the `qaoa_utils.py` file.
