In this folder you will find the files necessary to carry out the performance study of the pure Gibbs states. Each of the `.py` files is intended to perform a performance test, here is the purpose of each one:

- `qaoa_max_cut_border_hadamard_state.py` : implements a performance comparison between Gibbs states and the Hadamard state $\ket{+}^{\otimes n}$.

- `qaoa_max_cut_border_one_state.py` : implements a performance comparison between Gibbs states and products states.

- `qaoa_max_cut_border_one_state.py` : implements a performance comparison between Gibbs states and products states.
